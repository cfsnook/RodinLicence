Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the CODA

<ul>
<li>Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 ("EPL") (available at <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"
 >http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html</a>)</li>
 
</ul>

</p>

<p>Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code,
   documentation and other files maintained in the CODA repository ("Repository").</p>
    
<p>The terms and conditions governing Features and Included Features
   should be contained in files named "licence.html" ("Feature

   Download or Module including, but not limited to the following
   locations:</p>

<ul>

<li>Feature directories</li>

<p>Note: if a Feature made available by the CODA Project is
   installed using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a
   licence ("Feature Update Licence") during the installation process.
   If the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update
   Licence should either provide you with the terms and conditions
   governing the Included Features or inform you where you can locate
   them.  Feature Update Licences may be found in the "licence"
   property of files named "feature.properties" found within a
